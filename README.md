# Animated Login

For the first 3 challenges, you may simply open `index.html` in each folder.
> For challenge 3, you may also choose to do the same as challenge 4 below.

## Challenge 3 and 4
`npm install`

### Running in development
`npm run serve`

⚠️ You might need to switch to older Node versions if you encounter issues. `8.17.0` works for me.


### Testing
- `npm test`
- `npm test -- --coverage` or open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` ([example](challenge%204%20-%20vue,%20responsive,%20test/coverage/lcov-report/index.html))
